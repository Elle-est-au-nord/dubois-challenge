### A Series Of Statistical Charts Illustrating The Conditions Of Descendants Of Formal African Slaves Now Resident In The Unites States (plate 37), April 8

Note: While looking for shapefile of a US map of 1900, I found the website [historicalmapchart.net](https://historicalmapchart.net/) that provides historical map. I downloaded the 1900 US map and coloured it using Gimp.

My contribution was made with python, historicalmapchart, Gimp and Canva.
